[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/toolness/steampunk.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/toolness/steampunk)

Steampunk IRC is a simple web-based IRC client with Twitter integration.
A user's browser connects to a server which maintains a persistent connection
to an IRC server (similar to bouncers like [ZNC][]) and relays messages
between the browser and the IRC server. Users can easily see messages
they missed while they were offline.

The name *Steampunk* was chosen because my colleague [Pascal Finette][finette]
once jokingly referred to IRC as [steampunk][], which I found both
humorous and apt.

This project is highly experimental and the UI is quite preliminary.

## Quick Start

    git clone git://github.com/toolness/steampunk.git
    cd steampunk
    npm install
    npm test
    cp config.sample.json storage-data/config.json

Edit `config.json` to taste. Note that the `audience` parameter should be
set to the origin of your web server; this will be used for [Persona][]
login, though you can also ignore this field if you only want to authenticate
using username/password authentication.

Now run:

    node app.js

Navigate to [localhost:3000/test][] to run the browser-side test suite.
Then go to [localhost:3000][].

## Basic Commands

Type **/** to see a list of all available commands.

* **/login** *username* *password* - Logs you into the server with the given
username and password, which should be listed in `config.json`. Your
credentials are stored persistently in your browser; if you want to purge
them, use **/logout**.

* **/join** *#channel* - Joins you to *#channel*.

* **/twittername** *nick* *twittername* - Associates the IRC user *nick* with
the Twitter user *twittername*. This association is global for all users
of the Steampunk server you're connected to.

* **#channel** *message* - Broadcasts a message to **#channel**. You can 
abbreviate the channel name and the client will automatically send your
message to the closest unique channel that you're joined to.

* **@username** *message* - Sends a private message to *username*.
